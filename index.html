                Finding you has been one of the most fulfilling discoveries in my life. I still remember the day I saw you heading for the Miss CBU concert and I'll never forget how my CPU crashed at the sight of your heavenly beauty. I had the most painful headache and at that moment I just didn't feel the pain anymore. That's when I knew. That beauty, that aura, that character... I wasn't going to miss out on that. Three years later, I'm so glad we're here. You add so much colour to my life. Let's keep going and write our own unique story to be forever etched in history. I love you, babe.
